This timeline assumes you're working full-time on the project and doesn't account for potential roadblocks or additional features beyond the core MVP functionality. The actual time may vary based on the specific requirements of your MVP and any unexpected challenges that arise during development.

Remember, an MVP should focus on core functionality to validate your business idea. You can iterate and add more advanced features after launching the initial version and gathering user feedback.
