Certainly! Let's implement a Scrum-like approach for your project, adapting it for a solo developer. We'll break down the project into sprints, each lasting two weeks. Here's a proposed schedule based on the MVP timeline we discussed earlier:

Sprint 0 (1 week): Project Setup
- Set up development environment (Docker, Symfony, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, Redis)
- Create initial project structure
- Set up version control

Sprint 1-2 (4 weeks): Core Symfony Application
- Implement basic authentication (JWT)
- Create user management system
- Develop API structure
- Set up Symfony Messenger for job queuing

Sprint 3-4 (4 weeks): Python Worker and OR-Tools Integration
- Set up Python environment
- Implement basic scheduling algorithm with OR-Tools
- Integrate Python worker with RabbitMQ
- Implement result caching with Redis

Sprint 5 (2 weeks): Pricing Service and API Management
- Develop pricing service skeleton
- Implement basic API management (rate limiting, usage tracking)
- Set up API Platform and Nelmio API Doc

Sprint 6 (2 weeks): Admin Dashboard and Cron Jobs
- Set up EasyAdmin for basic CRUD operations
- Implement essential cron jobs for periodic tasks

Sprint 7 (2 weeks): Monitoring, Logging, and Testing
- Set up basic logging with ELK stack
- Implement simple monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana
- Write essential unit tests

Sprint 8 (2 weeks): MVP Refinement and Bug Fixing
- Refine API endpoints
- Perform integration testing
- Fix critical bugs
- Prepare for MVP launch

Total: 17 weeks (about 4 months)

For each sprint:

1. Sprint Planning (Day 1):
   - Review and prioritize backlog items
   - Set sprint goals
   - Break down tasks and estimate effort

2. Daily Standup (Every day):
   - Review what was done yesterday
   - Plan what to do today
   - Identify any blockers

3. Sprint Work (Days 1-9):
   - Focus on implementing the planned features
   - Regularly commit code and push to version control

4. Sprint Review (Day 10):
   - Demo completed features to yourself or a trusted advisor
   - Document progress and lessons learned

5. Sprint Retrospective (Day 10):
   - Reflect on what went well and what could be improved
   - Adjust process as needed for the next sprint

6. Backlog Grooming (Ongoing):
   - Continuously refine and prioritize backlog items

Remember to:
- Keep your backlog updated and prioritized
- Use a tool like Trello or Jira to track your progress
- Be flexible and adjust your plan as you learn more about the project
- Take regular breaks and avoid burnout
- Celebrate small wins along the way

This schedule provides a structured approach to building your MVP while allowing for flexibility and continuous improvement. As a solo developer, you might find that some Scrum practices are less relevant, but the overall structure can help keep you organized and focused on delivering value incrementally.
